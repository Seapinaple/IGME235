    <h2>Goal</h2>

    <p>
        The goal of the sight is to be able to duisplay information. The layout was chosen in such a way that you can have an image such as the skills for a specific class then in the paragraph right next to the image be able to explain the reasoning those skills are in the build.
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>
        With the built to spec portion of the project there were a couple challenging parts. Getting the images to allign properly with the text wrap was challenging and I was unable to find away for a paragraph to wrap around the top and bottom of an image that has been floated to the right.
