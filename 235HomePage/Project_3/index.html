        <h2>Game Title</h2>
        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Lil Kitty</p>
        
        <h3>High Concept</h3>
        <p>A 2D world drawn from the top down where you are a cat exploring the basement of a house. There are things to interact such as you can score points by catching mice. Short experience that will end once a certain number of things are explored.</p>

        <h3>Genre</h3>
        <p>Top-down adventure / exploration game.</p>

        <h3>Platform</h3>
        <p>Desktop only.</p>

        <h3>Story</h3>
        <p>You are a cat that got trapped in the basement and needs to escape.</p>

        <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
        <p>Aiming for a kind of pixel art thats detailed enough to not look too blocky but still seem like a style. Also, a darker theme in general.</p>

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>Arrow / WASD keys to move and the player will learn to play by a image that shows at the start with the controls then it fades once the player starts playing and exploring.</p>

        <h3>Mockups</h3>
        <p>Include at least two mockup images of the game interface.</p>
        <img src="photo1.png" alt="Mockup 1" class="mockup" style="transform: rotate(270deg); max-width: 20vw; max-height: 20vw; width: auto; height: auto;">
        <img src="photo2.png" alt="Mockup 2" class="mockup" style="transform: rotate(270deg); max-width: 20vw; max-height: 20vw; width: auto; height: auto;">

        <h3>Other</h3>
        <p>Using PIXI JS for visuals and howler for sound.</p>
